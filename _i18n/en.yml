  bio: | 
    All my entire career I have a deal with diffirent business processes: developing & manufacturing products, 
    B2B sales & marketing, relationships between government and private sector, startup launching, etc. 
    And I have noticed that Web products are becoming not just a necessary element of any business process, 
    but are gradually becoming leading roles. Investment in Web products leads to added value growth, 
    reducing of total costs and speeding up of activities. As a result I have decided to dive deep into the Web Developing, 
    especially Ruby on Rails (RoR) ecosytem, and started to be as professional developer. 
    So now I'm trying to do my best to growth as Web Developer and help companies to reach business goals.

    Ruby is excellent way to interpret your thoughts and ideas to any machine through Object-oriented programming tools and with the assistance of unique Ruby community (who also creates awesome gems, patterns, education resources, etc.)

  scraping: |
    Nokogiri and OpenURI gems help to retreive data from the Web according to individual settings and then Ruby 
    builtin methods allows to transform this data to any preferable format (output text to termianl console, 
    .xlsx tables, etc.).
  spec: |
    Currently I use RSpec tests (with FactoryBot and Capybara gems) for checking RoR models, controller actions, 
    policies, etc. For me tests are 'internal auditors', so 'due diligence' of an app is good technical and 
    business practice, so I am on my way to learn RSpec and other tests more deeply.
